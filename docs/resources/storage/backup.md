# Backup Management

Backups are managed copies of block storage volumes using the Aruba.Storage/backup resource. Unlike snapshots, backups provide advanced features like incremental backups, retention policies, and scheduled operations.

## Available Commands

- `acloud storage backup` - Create a new backup from a volume
- `acloud storage backup list` - List all backups
- `acloud storage backup get` - Get details of a specific backup
- `acloud storage backup update` - Update backup name and tags
- `acloud storage backup delete` - Delete a backup

## Backup vs Snapshot

| Feature | Backup | Snapshot |
|---------|--------|----------|
| API Resource | Aruba.Storage/backup | Aruba.Storage/snapshot |
| Backup Type | Full or Incremental | Full only |
| Retention Policy | Configurable days | Manual management |
| Billing Period | Hour, Month, Year | Default billing |
| Use Case | Long-term data protection | Quick point-in-time copies |

## Create Backup

## Update Backup

Update the name and/or tags of a backup.

**Important:** Backup cannot be updated while a restore operation is running on the associated volume. The backup must be in "Active" status (not "InCreation" or "Deleting").

### Usage

```bash
acloud storage backup update <backup-id> [flags]
```

### Arguments

- `backup-id` - The ID of the backup (supports auto-completion)

### Flags

- `--project-id` - Project ID (uses context if not specified)
- `--name` - New name for the backup
- `--tags` - New tags (comma-separated)

**Note:** At least one of `--name` or `--tags` must be provided.

### Example

```bash
# Update name only
acloud storage backup update 694594818f4a09c12b5e0c19 --name "backup-renamed"

# Update tags only
acloud storage backup update 694594818f4a09c12b5e0c19 --tags "prod,critical"

# Update both
acloud storage backup update 694594818f4a09c12b5e0c19 \
  --name "production-backup" \
  --tags "prod,critical"
```

### Output

```
Backup updated successfully!

Name:            production-backup
Tags:            [prod critical]
```

## Delete Backup

Delete a backup. This action cannot be undone.

**Important:** Cannot delete a backup if there are active restore operations.

### Usage

```bash
acloud storage backup delete <backup-id> [flags]
```

### Arguments

- `backup-id` - The ID of the backup (supports auto-completion)

### Flags

- `--project-id` - Project ID (uses context if not specified)
- `-y, --yes` - Skip confirmation prompt

### Example

```bash
# With confirmation prompt
acloud storage backup delete 694594818f4a09c12b5e0c19

# Skip confirmation
acloud storage backup delete 694594818f4a09c12b5e0c19 --yes
```

### Output

```
Backup 694594818f4a09c12b5e0c19 deleted successfully!
```

## Backup Types

### Full Backup
- Complete copy of the volume
- Can be used independently for restore
- Takes more time and storage space
- Recommended for: Weekly/monthly archives, critical data protection

### Incremental Backup
- Only stores changes since last backup
- Faster and uses less storage
- Requires previous backups for restore
- Recommended for: Daily backups, frequent snapshots

## Retention Policy

- Backups can have a retention period in days
- After retention period expires, backups may be automatically deleted
- Set retention based on your compliance and recovery requirements
- Common retention periods: 7 days (weekly), 30 days (monthly), 365 days (yearly)

## Best Practices

1. **Use Full backups for baseline**: Create weekly full backups as recovery points
2. **Incremental for daily**: Use incremental backups for daily protection
3. **Tag appropriately**: Use tags to identify backup purpose and schedule
4. **Monitor retention**: Track backup ages and adjust retention as needed
5. **Test restores**: Periodically verify backups can be restored successfully
6. **Delete old backups**: Clean up backups after retention period

## Notes

- Backups are created asynchronously and start in "InCreation" status
- Once "Active", backups can be used for restore operations
- Tags must be maximum 20 characters each
- The volume ID can be found using `acloud storage blockstorage list`
- Backups use the Aruba.Storage/backup API resource (different from snapshots)
