# TECH_DEBT.md — Technical Debt & Refactoring Backlog

Issues are grouped by severity. Address Critical items before new features ship; High items before any public release.

## Resolved

| ID | Summary |
|----|---------|
| TD-001 | All `Run` handlers converted to `RunE`; `SilenceUsage: true`; `fmtAPIError` helper in `root.go` |
| TD-002 | Nil guards added for `LocationResponse`, `Metadata.ID`, `Metadata.Name` in all list/create/update responses |
| TD-003 | Errors propagated via `return fmt.Errorf(...)` instead of printing to stdout |
| TD-004 | Flag read errors checked via `RunE` return paths |
| TD-005 | `confirmDelete()` helper in `root.go` detects non-interactive stdin before prompting |
| TD-006 | `newCtx()` helper in `root.go` applies 30-second timeout to all SDK calls |
| TD-007 | `getContextFilePath` returns `(string, error)` instead of silently falling back to CWD |
| TD-008 | YAML unmarshal errors wrapped with user-friendly messages in `LoadConfig` and `LoadContext` |
| TD-009 | `MarkFlagRequired` used as the single mechanism for all required flags; redundant `if flag == ""` manual checks removed from all 19 affected commands |
| TD-011 | `readSecret()` helper added to `root.go` using `golang.org/x/term.ReadPassword`; `config set` now prompts interactively when `--client-secret` is not passed and no secret exists in config |
| TD-012 | `--debug` flag description updated to warn about credential/token exposure in HTTP headers |
| TD-013 | `Args: cobra.NoArgs` added to all `create` and `list` commands that take no positional arguments |
| TD-014 | `cmd/constants.go` created with `StateInCreation`, `DateLayout`, `FilePermConfig`, `FilePermDirAll`; all magic strings replaced |
| TD-016 | Global `--output` flag (table/json) added; `PrintTable` serialises to JSON when `--output=json` is set; no call-site changes needed |
| TD-017 | `listParams(cmd)` helper added; `--limit`/`--offset` flags added to all 25 list commands; list RunE handlers now pass pagination params to SDK |
| TD-018 | Global client cache vars encapsulated in `clientState` struct with `resetClientState()` helper; all test reset blocks updated to use it |
| TD-010 | Table-driven `RunE` tests added for all 23 testable command files (24 including pre-existing `network.vpc_test.go`); mock infrastructure in `cmd/mock_test.go` covers all sub-clients; `security.kms.go` skipped (concrete SDK type, cannot mock); nil-pointer bugs in `LocationResponse.Value` and `CreationDate.IsZero()` fixed as a side effect of test authoring; redundant double nil-check blocks left by AWK generation cleaned up in 5 files |

## Medium

### TD-015 · Fragile raw-JSON workaround for CloudServer ID extraction
`cmd/compute.cloudserver.go` manually unmarshals `response.RawBody` into `map[string]interface{}` to extract the resource ID because the SDK's typed response struct does not expose it. This breaks silently if the API response shape changes.

**Status:** Blocked on SDK — the typed response struct does not expose the resource ID field.

**Fix:** When the SDK exposes the ID in its typed response, remove the raw-JSON workaround. Until then, the raw-JSON path must be preserved; a comment in the code documents the dependency.

## Low

### TD-019 · No `--dry-run` flag on destructive operations
Users cannot validate that a delete command would succeed (permissions, resource existence) without actually deleting the resource.

**Fix:** Add `--dry-run` to all delete commands. In dry-run mode, perform a `get` to validate the resource exists and the client has access, then print what would happen without calling `delete`.

---

### TD-020 · Inconsistent success messages across resources
Success messages vary: `"...created successfully!"`, `"...initiated. Use 'get' to check status."`, `"Resource created, but no details returned."`. The last form is especially confusing — it implies partial success.

**Fix:** Standardise to two patterns: a definitive success message when the API confirms completion, and an async-operation message when the API returns accepted-but-pending.

---

### TD-021 · Many commands missing `Long` descriptions
Most leaf commands (get, create, update, delete) have only a `Short` description. `acloud <resource> create --help` provides minimal guidance on valid flag values or usage examples.

**Fix:** Add `Long` and `Example` fields to at minimum all `create` commands, documenting flag valid values and a copy-paste example invocation.

---

### TD-022 · Pre-release SDK version (v0.1.x)
`go.mod` depends on `github.com/Arubacloud/sdk-go v0.1.21`. The `0.x` major version provides no semantic versioning stability guarantee — a minor-version bump may introduce breaking changes.

**Fix:** Track the SDK release roadmap. When a `v1.0.0` is released, migrate and pin to it. Until then, pin to a specific minor version and treat any upgrade as potentially breaking.
