## Installation

Precompiled binaries are available for Windows, Linux, and macOS.  
No additional runtime dependencies are required.

### Windows

```powershell

## Linux

### Ubuntu 22.04+ and most modern distributions
```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/Arubacloud/acloud-cli/releases/latest/download/acloud-linux-amd64
chmod +x acloud-linux-amd64
sudo mv acloud-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/acloud
```


### Ubuntu 20.04 or older WSL distributions (GLIBC 2.31 compatible)

```
If you encounter GLIBC errors such as GLIBC_2.34 not found, use the -ubuntu20 binary.

## MacOS
```bash

```
---

## Configuration
Before using the CLI, you must configure your Aruba Cloud API credentials.

### Set Credentials
```bash
acloud config set \
  --client-id YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
  --client-secret YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
```

You can also set values individually:
```bash
acloud config set --client-id YOUR_CLIENT_ID
acloud config set --client-secret YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
```

Credentials are stored securely in:
```bash
~/.acloud.yaml
```

### View Configuration
```bash
acloud config show
```
---

## Quick Start
### 1. Configure Credentials
```bash
acloud config set --client-id YOUR_CLIENT_ID --client-secret YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
```

### 2. Create and Use a Context (Recommended)
Contexts allow you to work with a specific project without repeatedly passing --project-id
```bash
acloud context set my-prod --project-id "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
acloud context use my-prod
```

### 3. Explore Resources
```bash
# List projects
acloud management project list

# List block storage volumes
acloud storage blockstorage list

# List snapshots
acloud storage snapshot list
```

## Context Management
Manage multiple project contexts to simplify multi-environment workflows:
```bash
acloud context set prod --project-id "prod-project-id"
acloud context set dev --project-id "dev-project-id"
acloud context set staging --project-id "staging-project-id"

acloud context use prod
acloud context use dev

acloud context current
acloud context list
acloud context delete staging
```bash

## Usage
```bash
acloud --help
acloud config --help
```

## Debug Mode
```bash
acloud --debug network vpc list
# Short form
acloud -d network vpc list
```

Debug mode enables:
- HTTP request and response logging
- Detailed JSON payloads
- Full error response details

Debug output is sent to stderr and does not interfere with command output.

## Testing
End-to-end (E2E) tests validate CRUD operations across all resource categories.

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
export ACLOUD_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
export ACLOUD_REGION="ITBG-Bergamo"
```

## Run E2E Tests
```bash
./e2e/management/test.sh
./e2e/storage/test.sh
./e2e/network/test.sh
./e2e/container/test.sh
```

Container (KaaS) tests require additional environment variables.
